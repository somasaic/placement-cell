# Placement Cell
A nodejs web app to manage students and their placements and download interview reports.

Placement Cell

A company constantly needs to download their data to compile different reports. You need to create an interface for the employees of this company to fill in the data into the database and then download it in CSV format. 

Create a complete web application, not an API
